Breakdown of the JavaScript Code

1. const vport = document.getElementsByClassName('vport')[0];

This line selects the first HTML element with the class name "vport" and stores it in the vport variable. This element is likely a text input or display area where the calculator's input and output will be shown.
2. function setDefaultViewPortValue() { vport.innerHTML = "0"; }

This function sets the inner HTML of the vport element to "0". It's used to clear the display or initialize it with a default value.
3. function addToViewPort(value) { ... }

This function is triggered when a number or operator button is clicked.
It first checks if the current vport value is "Error", "Infinity", "-Infinity", or "NaN". If so, it resets the vport to "0".
Then, it checks if the current vport value is "0" and the incoming value is not an operator. If so, it directly sets the vport value to the value to avoid leading zeros.
Finally, it appends the value to the existing vport content, ensuring that multiple consecutive operators are not allowed.
4. function backspaceViewPort() { ... }

This function is triggered when the backspace button is clicked.
It checks if the current vport value is an error state. If so, it resets the vport to "0".
Otherwise, it removes the last character from the vport value.
If the vport becomes empty after removing the character, it resets it to "0".
5. function displayCalculation() { ... }

This function is triggered when the equal button is clicked.
It attempts to evaluate the expression in the vport using the eval() function.
If the evaluation is successful, the result is displayed in the vport.
If an error occurs during evaluation, the vport is set to "Error: Invalid expression".
Note:

While eval() is a convenient way to evaluate expressions, it can be a security risk if not used carefully. It's recommended to use a more robust expression parsing and evaluation library for complex calculations.
Consider adding more features like parentheses, trigonometric functions, and scientific notation to enhance the calculator's functionality.
Implement error handling for different types of errors, such as division by zero or invalid input.
Test the calculator thoroughly to ensure accurate calculations and user-friendly behavior.
